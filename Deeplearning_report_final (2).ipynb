    "Automatic music genre classification is a problem that has many practical applications and for which deep learning and machine learning techniques can be applied. This project analyzes the performance and applicability of different classifiers  on the problem of classifying music into genres. The dataset, consisting of 4363 labeled training data points and 6544 test data points, is found to be very imbalanced, vary in magnitude and contain some outliers. The aim is to train a classifier for the problem appliying supervised and unsupervised methods. The gaussian mixture model fuzzy clustering is applied as an unsupervised method and logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis,  neural networks and convolutional network as  supervised methods. The results for these methods are compared. It was found that good results could not be obtained with clustering, therefore the project is settled with comparing the methods with each other individually. Simple linear logistic regression proved to be the best of the methods attempted.\n",

    "Composing music is a challenging realm where human creativity gets to manifest and which requires special training. There might be general guidelines as to how to compose music pieces but there are not exact rules to build up on, and as such generating this might be a challenging activity for machines, and nevertheless of one of the important steps in that process is for the machine to recognize the musical structure. If we are to be able to conduct and design algorithms that is capable of constructing musical structures, we can optimize music platforms more efficiently (Engel et al., 2018). \n",
    "\n",
    "Music information retrieval is a broad field of research, and the main thread is to extract information from songs. This can in fact have different applications such as music transcription, copyright monitoring, music management  (for example to find the composer)\n",
    "Such algorithms are an important part of digital music platforms  (Engel et al., 2018). For example to identify song moods and emotions as well as music recommendation systems, playlist generation, studying the statistical relationship between melody and harmony and optimizing song search. Such measurements are key for such as Spotify, Soundcloud and Apple music (Mintz et al., 2018). \n",
    "However most of current approaches that tackle these problems, build on user input or song file metadata which can have low scalability and are highly subjective, given that more than 75000 new albums are released every year in US alone.  Therefore automatic techniques for genre classification are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is particularly interesting since the kind of data is different from the data contexts with which we have typically worked before. Studying how musical structure can be defined in terms of a variety of technical features will further add to our understanding of music information (Engel et al, 2018).\n",
    "Conducting this project will help us strengthen our intuition of multi classification algorithms and model tuning, as well as how a machine learning pipeline is structured and organized. \n",
    " \n",
    "The song features are divided into training set and testing set. The training set is used to train the classifiers, which are logistic regression and neural networks. Using the testing set the accuracy of the classifier will be found (Engel et al,.2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal for this project was to attempt a similar semi-supervised approach than in (Poria et al., 2013), which combines unsupervised clustering with supervised classification. However, no good results could be obtained with the clustering method, Gaussian Mixture Model based fuzzy clustering, so I compare the intended classification methods with each other individually. These methods include, in addition to clustering, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis,  a multilayer perceptron neural network and the convolutional neural network. None of the methods seem to perform particularly well, with simple linear logistic regression offering the best predictive power (Mintz et al., 2018).\n"

    "The dataset is a custom subset of the Million Song Dataset, and the labels were obtained from\n",
    "AllMusic.com. The Million Song Dataset is a freely-available collection of audio features and\n",
    "metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks. Each song has 264 features, and there\n",
    "are 10 possible classes in total. The core of the dataset is the feature analysis and metadata for\n",
    "one million songs, provided by The Echo Nest. The features provided are a summary\n",
    "representation of the 3 main components of music: timbre, pitch (melody and harmony) and\n",
    "rhythm.\n",
    "The dataset does not include any audio, only the derived features. The data sets on which the solution is based are features extracted from songs. The extracted data contains samples of statistics on rhythm, chroma, and MFCC for individual songs. Total number of samples in the data set is 10907, of which 4363 are labeled as belonging to a specific genre out of total of 10 possible genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "(https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong)\n",
    "Some statistics of the dataset:\n",
    "1. 1,000,000 songs / files\n",
    "2. 273 GB of data\n",
    "3. 44,745 unique artists\n",
    "4. 7,643 unique terms (The Echo Nest tags)\n",
    "5. 43,943 artists with at least one term\n",
    "6. 2,201,916 asymmetric similarity relationships\n",
    "7. 515,576 dated tracks starting from 1922\n",
    "8. 18,196 cover songs identified\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the labeled data is problematic: about half of the data is labeled into one class, whereas the most infrequent class contains only less than one hundred samples. The imbalance of the data set is typical for many real-world cases where getting enough or representativive samples of labeled data is very hard or expensive. Since most classificatication methods work best with a roughly balanced data sets, the imbalance will require extra attention in pre-processing and classification method selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample of the data set contains 264 features. The feature value ranges were quite different - scaled ranging from 0..1 to 0..3000. It was also found out that some of the chroma and MFCC features were constant or almost constant, and in contradiction with other features. These aspects call for cleaning the data (removing features where the input data is probably corrupted) and scaling the data so that all features have similar ranges. It was also found out (by computing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test value (Arsenault,2018)) and also visually that the statistics of the labeled data were quite similar to the unlabeled case - the transformations done on the labeled data set should not disturb the final prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to classify preprocessed audio information into 10 genres, pop-rock, electronic, rap, jazz, latin, rnb, international, country, reggae and blues. The audio information dataset consists of 4363 data points for training, and 6544 for testing. Each data point has 264 features, which provide a summary representation of the three main components of music: timbre, pitch and rhythm. More specifically, rhythm is is described by the amount of modulation on certain frequency ranges, timbre by the first 12 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, and pitch by 12 distinct chrome values.\n"

    "### 2.2. Preprocessing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data having a bad quality may seriously hamper the accuracy of the classifier that the training yields. Two types of problems with the data may be identified: bad data points called outliers, and bad features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1. Finding outliers and Missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers refer to data points that dramatically differ from the majority of the training data. If we assume that the training data is generated by some probability distribution, the outliers would be points that seem to be generated by a completely different distribution than most of the data. These kind of points may be in the training data for example due to an error in producing and preprocessing the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly, data points identified as outliers are simply removed from the data. A rationale for this is that the outliers have a relatively large impact on the resulting classifier, but it is unlikely that the test data would contain similar data points, so this impact is harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be beneficial to also identify outliers in the test data. This is because there may be no reason the expect that classifiers trained on \"usual\" data points are applicable on extraordinary points that seem to come from another distribution. In this case, we can identify that the predictions for these points are highly untrustworthy. Moreover, outliers in test data needed to be removed for the clustering approach that uses the test data for training in an unsupervised manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project  multiple methods of outlier removal were considered. The simplest was to simply identify an outlier from that its euclidean distance to a mean is large. For labeled training data, the mean was the class mean, whereas for unlabeled test data the mean for all points was used. Also, I tried a method called Local Outlier Factor (LOF) (Scikit, *Novelty and Outlier Detection*). A very rough descrpiption of it is that it compares the distances of a point *p* to its neighbors to the distances from the neighbors to their respective neighbors, and identifies *p* as an outlier if the former distances are considerably larger than the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with these methods is the high dimensionality of the data. In high-dimensional space, the variance in distances between points tends to be very small, so it is hard to distinguish outliers. Additionally, data points that appear to be outliers for the original data may not be outliers anymore after dimensionality reduction, if the point is unusual only with respect to features that are ignored in the reduced data. Thus, I also applied the above techniques to data whose dimension was reduced using linear discriminant analysis (LDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "This however raises a further concern: If outliers are only removed after dimensionality reduction, do they affect the dimensionality reduction process itself? We know that LDA tries to minimize in-class variance, so an outlier might cause the LDA to choose a projection where the outlier is near the class mean, but which is overall worse than the respective projection without the outlier. For this reason, I tested one further method for outlier detection, where I identified an outlier based on how much removing a point before projection reduces the in-class variance of the projected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I played around with all of these alternatives. In particular, the I have included code for distinguishing outliers in LDA-projected training data by euclidean distance and decrease in in-class variance in the classes *Outlier_remover_lda_distance* and *Outlier_remover_lda_inclass_variance*, respectively. These classes are inteded to be used with the Python command line interpreter. For outlier removal from test data I used the function *outliers_for_unlabeled*, which uses LOF on data whose dimension was reduced using LDA trained on the labeled training data. LOF scores for the data points are presented in figure as output of the last code cell of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different choices of training data outliers were tested by training an LDA classifier on the pruned training data. Every choice of outliers tried caused a decrease in validation accuracy, so I concluded that the training data does not contain outliers that should be removed for the clustering approach. For outliers in test data, I similarly considered the impact that removing then causes on the performance of clustering. Here, I noticed significant improvement when removing the data points with indices 6631, 7307, 9366, 9580, 9755, 10142, 10509 and 10556.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first scatter plot figure in the previous section presents visually how unlabeled data (the gray data points) contain much worse outliers than the labeled data (colourful points). However, this visual analysis is somewhat untrustworthy as the projection is made using LDA, which specifically tries to minimized in-class variance whereas it does not care about the unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2. Analyzing features\n",
    "\n",
    "For identifying bad features, the first method  was simply looking at the data. We observed that the features indexed 216-220 (inclusive) had each an identical value for all data points. Thus it was completely clear that they should removed in all cases as they provide no information and are thus useless. Moreover, they are harmful, since they make the data matrix and feature covariance matrix singular, causing computational difficulties for ML methods relying on e.g. matrix inversion. Such problems were observed with clustering techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I identified a number of features which had the same value for most data points. Even these features may cause singularity issues when only handling a subset of data, and making an unluckly choice of data points such that all points have the same value for the feature. Subsets for data points are considered e.g. with cross validation. Even when handling all the data at the same time, the condition number, strongly related to computational feasibility, probably increases significantly due to these features. A listing of them can be found in the function *features_to_take* below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second of the methods to remove undesirable features is linear discriminant analysis which I used for dimensionality reduction for the clustering approach. It is described it in section 3.1.3. Finally, it was checked that there are no null values in the data.\n",

    "#### 3.1. Overview of the Deep learning and ML methods used\n",
    "A selection of six machine learning classifiers are studied: logistic regression,linear discriminant analysis, clustering and a combined approach were naive bayesian classifier and clustering are combined, these methods then are then compared to two deep learning techniques: multi layer perceptron and convolutional network.  These methods are applied fot the purpose of multi-class classification and  are considered for both original and upsampled data. In training phase, training data is further split using K-fold cross-validation (Geron, 2017) method (in this case K=5 is used) to get performance metrics on the behaviour of the classifier.\n",
    "After getting overall results from the performance of the classifiers (and hyperparameter search for one of them), their results are compared. When evaluating their relative merits  the log-loss metric are considered in addition to accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1. Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning method for training binary classifiers [jung_machine]. The predictor $h$ is based on a linear map $h(x) = \\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}$, for which the training process finds the optimal weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$. The predicted label $\\hat{y}_i \\in \\{-1, 1 \\}$ is decide by the rule $\\hat{y}_i = 1$ if $h(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq 0$ and $\\hat{y}_i = -1$ if $h(x) < 0$. Loss is measured by the function $\\epsilon(w \\mid X) = (1/N) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log(1+ \\exp(-y_i \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}))$. The optimal weight vector can be found using e.g. gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiclass classification can be achieved e.g. by the one-vs-all method. There for every class a binary classifier is trained that distinguishes between points of that class and all the other classes. The final label is obtained by comparing the values of $h(x)=\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}$ from the different binary classifiers, and choosing the label that correspond to the highest value (i.e. for each binary classifierlabel 1 corresponds to the class that is being distinguished and -1 to all the others).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.2. Gaussian Mixture Model Fuzzy Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work I use as an unsupervised method fuzzy clustering based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) [jung_machine]. Roughly speaking, gaussian mixtures are probability distributions that consist of preset number of individual gaussian distributions with different parameters, where each individual distribution is equated to a cluster. The goal of the method is to learn the Gaussian Mixture that best explains the data. This is done via an iteration process which alternates between updating the distribution parameters and the probabilities for each data point to belong to each cluster/gaussian. The iteration finds a local optimum that is not guaranteed to be globally optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.3. Linear discriminant analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a supervised learning method for training a classifier and for dimensionality reduction, both purposes of which I also make use of (Scikit, *Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis*). Like GMM fuzzy clustering, LDA is also based on finding gaussian distributions which best explain the data. A key difference to GMM clustering is that the class labels are known beforehand, which allows us to estimate the parameters of the gaussians via closed-from formulas. Also in LDA, the covariance matrices are the same for the gaussians for each class. (Allowing an unique covariance for each class leads to a somewhat more general method, quadratic discriminant analysis.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlabeled data points are then classified according to which gaussian is most likely to have been produced the data point. This leads to linear decision surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method for dimensionality reduction is obtained as follows: First, since the covariances are equal for all the gaussians, I can perform a linear change of coordinates such that the covariance matrix becomes an identity matrix in the resulting space. Due to the covariance being the idenity, I can classify points based on euclidean distance from the class centres. This however can be performed equally well if I project the data onto a hyperplane that is spanned by the class centres. These linear mappings together yield the linear transformation for reducing dimensionality of the data. This derivation also explains the fact that the maximum number of dimensions after projection for LDA is the number of classes minus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative view of LDA (and a side-effect of the above) is that it maximizes the ratio between variance of the class centres to in-class variance, thus finding a linear projection that separates the classes as well as possible from one another. An exposition from this viewpoint is given in (Tharwat et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.4. Neural Network: A multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks have the ability to model data with high volatility and volume and with complex relations. \n",
    "Deep multilayer network is chosen as a model, because they have shown to yield good out-of-the-box classification accuracies for many scenarioes (Mintes et al., 2018). They have also been used successfully in music classification tasks (Mints etal., 2018). They make for a general purpose classifier, because they don't require a lot of pre-processing for the data. This is possible, because they are built to classify the data according to the most features they consider the most important. This also implies that they are not very sensible to outliers in the data, because outliers generally are not very important for the whole dataset. Since the music dataset for this project has some outliers, this was considered a useful property.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose I tried different architecture of multilayer perceptron is suitable for classification prediction problems and particularly when I are dealing with large datasets. For multilayer perceptron I imported Keras package from Theano neural network library, where I used sequential model configured with varying number of hidden layers, drop out rates and nodes. Here the models is as:\n",
    "Neural network configuration: epoches=50, batch_size=394, tanh activation function, and 3 hidden layers, training time of 30 seconds. The hyperparameters of the model were optimized  by doing cross validation with different values for the hyperparameters on the training data set. The hyperparameters were chosen such that they yielded the best average scrore for all cross validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furtheremore, a 1D convolution layer creates a convolution kernel that passes over a single spatial (or temporal) dimension to produce a tensor of outputs (see documentation). This process can be applied to one-dimensional sequences of data. The model extracts features from sequences data and maps the internal features of the sequence. A 1D CNN is very effective for deriving features from a segmenst of the overall dataset, where it is not so important where the feature is located in the segment. Analysis of signal data over a fixed-length period, for example, an audio recording can be conducted applying convolutional network. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project there was one main reason why convolutional network was also applied. It is not mentioned in the documentation of the data whether there is sequential in the data structure(Choi, 2017). It was not evident wether the data is structured in sequence and order. Therefore I thought to try out convolutional network and compare the results, since audio data could possibly have sequential order(Lee, 2009).\n",
    "The architecture of the network is:\n",
    "1d convolutional layer with kernel size 3 (no padding) followed by reLU, \n",
    "1d convolutional layer with kernel size 3 (no padding) followed by reLU, \n",
    "Max-pooling layer with kernel size 2 and stride 2, \n",
    "A fully-connected layer with 100  outputs, \n",
    "followed by relu, \n",
    "A fully-connected layer, \n",
    "follower by softmax\n",
    "The 1D layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved with the layer input over a single spatial (or temporal) dimension to produce a tensor of outputs. If use_bias is True, a bias vector is created and added to the outputs. Finally, if activation is not None, it is applied to the outputs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Combined approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The intention was to combine the unsupervised and supervised methods reviewed above to obtain an semi-supervised learning method which I hypothesized would yield the best results. After preprocessing both the training and testing data, as detailed in section *WHAT*, I use unsupervised fuzzy clustering based on GMMs. The goal is to obtain clusterings, where the clusters correspond well to classes/genres. The obtained output is a probability matrix *P(i_point, i_class)*, where there is a cell for each data point - class pair telling the probability that the data point belongs to the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The plan was to then feed these probabilities as input for the two supervised ML methods, logistic regression and neural networks. One possiblity is to consider the probabilities for data point *p* for belonging to the classes as additional features of point *p*, and then proceed with usual supervised classification using either the one-vs-all or one-vs-one method. Another possibility would be to decide to classify points only to the *n* classes that are most likely correct based on clustering, which would entail training supervised classifiers for all combinations of *n* classes. I intended to only try *n=2*, in which case I would only need to train classifiers that distinguish between two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of combining unsupervised fuzzy clustering to supervised learning is from the article (Poria et al., 2013). The main differences between the approaches and that of the article are that the article uses fuzzy c-means clustering as the clustering method instead of GMM, and uses SVMs for the supervised learning. It tried other methods as well, but those were the ones they obtained the best results with. They managed to obtain an excellent prediction accuracy of 97.10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I did not manage to replicate those results. The main obstacle encountered was that I was not able to find good clusterings via GMMs. Thus, I did not see the incentive to try a combined approach, so I settled with trying the methods separately.\n",

    "The table below details the results obtained. All numbers except in the last column represent the error metric accuracy, which is defined as the proportion of predictions that are correct (where a prediction for each test data point is a single class label). Training accuracy is the accuracy for predictions made on the training data. I 5-fold cross validated all methods, so cross validation accuracy represents the average validation error. The cross validation was stratified, which implies that the relative frequencies of the labels were in each split as close as possible to the ones in all of the training data. The last two columns represents score obtained for predictions on unlabeled data, for which the correct labels were not available, but evaluation is performed as a part of a Kaggle competition to which the results were compared. In the last column, the logLoss error metric is used. As a result it was possible to correctly predict more than two thirds of labels in the given test dataset. The results could be more accurate and this issue is mainly based on the fact that the provided training dataset was heavily imbalanced in temrs of class distributions. \n",

    "In the project several classifiers in combination with preprocessing methods were studied. The general finding was that the simplest method, logistic regression,  seemed to perform quite well, actually best results were gained with the simplest ways. In the results table in the previous section, training accuracy is in all cases higher than cross validation accuracy, as expected. However, the difference is modest, so no method suffers from significant overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The imbalance of the data set (about 50% of the samples belonged to one class) was initially a quite serious concern. When training the classifiers, smallest classes had only less than 20 samples, which is a very low number. It was a bit surprising to see that convolutional neural network was not the best classification method in the end. The literature on convolutional networks classification suggests that it copes quite well with overfitting (Choi, 2017). It is possible that the hyper parameter search was not extended to a wide enough range to find the best-performing parameters for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main metrics to measure the quality of the machine learning models were accuracy and logarithmic loss. It was found that logarithmic loss is a more relevant measure for this kind of machine learning problem and training dataset. Firstly, logarithmic loss is more suitable for multiclass problems, because it preserves more information about how likely a label is predicted to a certain datapoint. There are often cases where the model assigns a label to a datapoint with only a narrow margin. Logarithmic loss takes this into account, but a plain accuracy measure loses the probability information. Secondly, accuracy is not quite relevant metric to use with an imbalanced dataset. In the dataset, the majority of labels were ones. Training a classifier with a subset of that dataset usually makes the model biased towards ones. However, obtaining good accuracy results is not impossible, since the validation set also contains a lot of ones. \n",
    "A high accuracy score is possible even though classes 2 to 10 were classified poorly. Despite this, I think that accuracy is an important measure when validating a model. It is maybe the most intuitive one, and tells how trustworthy a model is.\n",
    "Finally, there is one potential source for overfitting with the clustering approach: Dimensionality reduction with LDA is trained with all of the labeled data.  This actually constitutes an error in the cross validation approach for clustering, which I noticed too late to have time to correct it, which could have been done by performing dimensionality reduction separately for each train-test-split, each time based on only the data that is training data relative to the current split. The implication of this error could be that the labeled data fits nicely into gaussian distributions in the projected space, but new points get projected further away from class centres due to being far away in directions in the original space where LDA assumed that no points are. \n",
    "\n",
    "The original goal was to reach results comparable to those of (Poria et al., 2013), where a similar approach was implemented that what we tried. However, this was failed at this with the most obvious reason being the problems with clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was found that logistic regression performs best. The difference to the methods LDA and neural networks is however not large either. The difference between multilayer perceptron and convolutional network is not significant. It is however surprising that the training accuracy is clearly better for logistic regression than for neural networks, since the hypothesis space for neural networks should be larger. Maybe the parameters of the neural network are suboptimal, or the trainig gets stuck at a local optimum?\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, it would be interesting to see if the combination of convolutional and multilayer perceptron would improve the results and to correct the cross validation approach used for GMM clustering, to see if it explains the observed disrepancy between validation scores. A positive answer would mean that LDA is not a suitable dimensionality reduction method due to the overfitting it causes. Thus, it would be interesting to explore other dimensionality reduction methods to find a better one. PCA is one option."
